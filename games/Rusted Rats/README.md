# Rust & Rats

**Team Members:** Louis Wang, Gleb Godynskiy

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Hollow Knight, but with rats, and it's significantly worse

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
A lot of rats. Also cool counters and movement.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
You exit the main room, go around killing bots and rats, and then loot their robot bodies for artificial organs to make yourself stronger!

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
I will keep them engaged with rats. A lot of rats. Like crazy amounts of rats. Also cool movement and combat but mostly rats. The final boss? It's all rats. You think it's a giant mechanical robot suit! 
WRONG!
It's fifty rats in a giant mechanical robot suit.
